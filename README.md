# Get OBS Timestamp

Currently, this repo has a standalone get_timestamp script
that can grab the current timestamp of the recording in
OBS studio. The details of the OBS studio WebSocket connection
and keyboard shortcut are currently personalized to be my own
however, they can be changed.

The repo also contains an app.py built on Flask which will
(eventually) serve as a backend for an application
to make the timestamp retrieval functionality more accessible
for everyone and customizable.

I will also be expanding the functionality of the app
to other utilities I find useful to have in controlling OBS
Studio. That will eventually change the name & nature of this
repo to be something more generalized and broad.
